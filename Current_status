Where am I:


current status:
After running the app (and the server) - we can do a search for other users, and
when clicking on one of them - we can see their last known location.
Currently this app works only locally. In order to publish it - the server needs to
be published in aws, and this app needs to be updated to use the updated apis of the server.


Need to fix:
when the app is killed by the user, and the phone is sleeping -
it can't get the location of the user (but I see that the firebase service gets the message).
the reason is that android limit the access to the location of the user in some cases (like this I guess),
so it will not consume battery or something. need to find a solution for it.
